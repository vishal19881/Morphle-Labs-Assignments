# Morphle Labs Pvt Ltd Assignment

This repository contains the solution and code for the Morphle Labs Pvt Ltd Assignment. It demonstrates the implementation of a Flask application with an `/htop` endpoint. The `/htop` endpoint provides essential system details such as the username, server time in IST, and the output of the `top` command. The application is designed to run seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces.

## Features

- **System Monitoring:** Displays real-time system information such as CPU usage, memory, and active processes using the `top` command.
- **User Information:** Retrieves and displays the current user running the Flask application.
- **Server Time in IST:** The server time is displayed in Indian Standard Time (IST) format.
